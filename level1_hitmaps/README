[Installation]

Script depends on cython code to be compiled first. Invoke:

:> python setup.py build_ext --inplace

[Running]

To run the script with default parameters use:

:> python level1_hitmap.py /path/to/level1.hd5

To see a list of options call:

:> python level1_hitmap.py --help

[Notes]

There is a "Source" class included in this script that has a dictionary of several key sources:
Tau A
Cas A
Cyg A

If you call the script with --source TauA the map will be centred on Tau A, and similarly for other sources
